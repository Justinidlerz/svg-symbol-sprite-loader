* Review the [code of conduct][conduct], we take it seriously!
* Use the git flow branching model when creating your PR (Fork the repo and create a
  feature/bug/documentation/test branch off of the **develop** branch).
* Commit your contribution 🎊
* Ensure that all tests pass (Running `npm test` will run all unit tests and linting
  validation).
